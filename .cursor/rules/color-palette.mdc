Colours should be chosen to match this palette where possible:
--pale-azure: #70d6ffff;
--cyclamen: #ff70a6ff;
--atomic-tangerine: #ff9770ff;
--naples-yellow: #ffd670ff;
--mindaro: #e9ff70ff;

However, this is not prescriptive, if a user would benefit from a strong Green or Red to match established design norms, then we may use some color that fits in well with these instead.

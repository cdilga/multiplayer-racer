# Logging guideslines

You must protect high frequency logs and refrain at all costs from logging normal behaviour within hot loops (ones that run at high frequencies)
If you MUST, absolutely MUST do it, then and only then may you include logs at a reduced frequency of about 1/1000 or another appropriate value, never more than 1 time in every 10 seconds.

For errors, you may log every error, especially if recovery doesn't make sense, but - this shouldn't continue in a loop I don't think.
